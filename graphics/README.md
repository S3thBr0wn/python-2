At this point we are using Zelle graphics.py to draw graphics.
HandsOnPython uses graphics.py
http://tritechsc.ksd.org/cyber/handsonpython/

<code>
from graphics import *
def main():
	win = GraphWin("My Circle", 200, 200)
	win.setBackground("#ff0000")
	c = Circle(Point(50,50), 10)
	c.draw(win)
	win.getMouse() # pause for click in window
	win.close()
main()

All of the following videos demo the graphics.py modules.
